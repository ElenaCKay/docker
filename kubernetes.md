# Kubernetes (K8s)

## What is K8s?

- Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source platform that manages containerized applications.
- It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containers.
- Google developed it, and it's now maintained by CNCF.

## Why use and learn K8s?

- Scalability: Easily scale applications based on demand.
- High availability: Ensures applications are always running, even after node failures.
- Portability: Consistently deploy applications across various environments.
- Automation: Automates many tasks, making development and operations smoother.
- Community: Large community and ecosystem support.

## Benefits to business

- Cost-effectiveness: Optimize resource utilization, reducing infrastructure costs.
- Faster time-to-market: Automate deployment for quicker application development.
- Improved reliability: Kubernetes manages application health, enhancing reliability.
- Enhanced collaboration: Promotes DevOps practices for smoother teamwork.
- Competitive advantage: Staying current with Kubernetes keeps businesses competitive.

## What are K8s objects?

- Persistent entities representing the cluster or applications.
- Examples: Pods, Services, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets.
- Each object has a defined specification and interacts with others.
- Managed using Kubectl or Kubernetes API.

## Concepts of labels and selectors

- Labels: Key-value pairs for identifying and categorizing K8s objects.
- Flexible use: Group objects based on application version, environment, etc.
- Selectors: Used to identify a set of objects based on their labels.
- Commonly used with ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, Deployments.
- Important for managing and scaling applications in Kubernetes.


#### YAML script for nginx

```
# K8 works with API versions to declare the resources
# We have to delclare the apiVersion and the kind of service/component
# services: deployment, service, pods, replicasets, crobjob, autoscalinggroup, horizontal pod scaling group (HPA)
# Kubect get service_name - deployment - pod - rs
# kubectl get deploy nginx_deploy (nginx_svc)
# kubectl get pods 
# kubect describe pod pod_name
# 


# YML is case sensitive - intendation of YML is important
# use spaces not a tab
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment
kind: Deployment # what kind of service/object you want to create
# what would you like to call it - name the service/object
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment # naming the deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # look for this label to match with k8 service
    # Let's create a replica set of this with  instances/pods
  replicas: 4             
    # template to use it's label for K8 service to launch in the browser
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # This label connects to 
                   #the service or any other k8 components
  # Let's define the container spec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx 
        image: ahskhan/eng89automatednginx:latest # use the image that you built
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# create a kubernetes nginx-service.yml to create a k8 service
```

#### YAML script for node app

A blocker I had with this was the version. Its must be the same version that I run. Filename: app-deploy.yml

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

metadata:
  name: app-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app

  replicas: 3

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: ellieckay/tech241-app-new:v2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000

```

### Docker and Kubernetes Commands

| Command                                          | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `docker build -t ellieckay/tech241-app-new:v2 .` | Build a Docker image with the tag `ellieckay/tech241-app-new:v2` from the current directory (`.`) |
| `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ellieckay/tech241-app-new:v2` | Run a container in detached mode (`-d`) mapping port 3000 from the host to port 3000 in the container, using the `ellieckay/tech241-app-new:v2` image |
| `docker ps`                                      | List all running Docker containers                                                           |
| `docker commit 15389e2f839a ellieckay-tech241-app-new:v2` | Create a new image (`ellieckay-tech241-app-new:v2`) from changes in a running container (`15389e2f839a`) |
| `docker push ellieckay/tech241-app-new:v2`       | Push the `ellieckay/tech241-app-new:v2` image to a Docker registry (assuming you have permissions to do so) |
| `kubectl create -f nginx-k8.yml`                 | Create Kubernetes resources (e.g., deployments, services) defined in the `nginx-k8.yml` file |
| `kubectl get deployment`                         | Get a list of deployments in the Kubernetes cluster                                       |

Please note that the `kubectl` commands assume you have the Kubernetes command-line tool (`kubectl`) installed and configured properly to work with your Kubernetes cluster.


## Implement Self Healing

If you delete a pod, another one will be created - Self healing.

To do this you need to make a SVC in a service file. Filename: app-service.yml

```
---

apiVersion: v1 # Relates to the version from deploy file
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: app-svc
  namespace: default # Used if multiple people are using the container

spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30002
    port: 3000 # Relates to the containerPort in deploy file
    targetPort: 3000

  selector:
    app: app # Relates to the label int he deploy file

  type: NodePort

```
